                            <p>An infamous tale, Sweeney Todd, an unjustly exiled barber, returns to nineteenth century London, seeking vengeance against the lecherous judge who framed him and ravaged his young wife. The road to revenge leads Todd to Mrs. Lovett, a resourceful proprietress of a failing pie shop, above which, he opens a new barber practice. Mrs. Lovett's luck sharply shifts when Todd's thirst for blood inspires the integration of an ingredient into her meat pies that has the people of London lining up... and the carnage has only just begun!</p>

                            <p>In roaring twenties Chicago, chorine Roxie Hart murders a faithless lover and convinces her hapless husband, Amos, to take the rap...until he finds out he's been duped and turns on Roxie. Convicted and sent to death row, Roxie and another "Merry Murderess," Velma Kelly, vie for the spotlight and the headlines, ultimately joining forces in search of the "American Dream": fame, fortune, and acquittal. This sharp-edged satire features a dazzling score that sparked immortal staging by Bob Fosse.</p>

                            <p>A manor stands alone in the English countryside. The roads are shutdown for miles with blizzard. A few miles away, a cry rings out in a small corner of London. A murder, whose perpetrator has set their sights on the manor. But all that's the least of our problems... because what on Earth are we going to have for dinner?! Come see all the danger, daring, and domestic disharmony in Agatha Christie's THE MOUSETRAP! Will these eight British idiots be able to keep themselves from getting offed? Is one of them really the murderer? And when is that bloody radiator going to get fixed?! All this and more at The Mousetrap!</p>

                            <p>THE HOUSE OF YES welcomes you to a wealthy, insular family living in Washington DC, just down the street from the Kennedy's home. Marty brings his fiancée home for Thanksgiving to meet his strange, insular family. This includes his unstable twin sister, who calls herself Jackie-O after Jackie Onassis Kennedy. Look forward to a hilarious, exciting, and thought-provoking evening as you see what unfolds this fateful Thanksgiving, after the doors are opened to the truth of wealth and insularity. Watch the characters reveal their true natures, blurred with amorality and the inability to understand the concept of “no”. Reality is not always certain. Welcome to The House of Yes.</p>

With the help of a hunchbacked sidekick, Igor, and a leggy lab assistant, Inga, Frederick finds himself in the mad scientist shoes of his ancestors. "It's alive!" he exclaims as he brings to life a creature to rival his grandfather's. Eventually, of course, the monster escapes and hilarity continuously abounds.</p>

                            <p>HEATHERS THE MUSICAL is the darkly delicious story of Veronica Sawyer, a brainy, beautiful teenage misfit who hustles her way into the most powerful and ruthless clique at Westerberg High: The Heathers. But before she can get comfortable atop the high school food chain, Veronica falls in love with the dangerously sexy new kid J.D. When Heather Chandler, the Almighty, kicks her out of the group, Veronica decides to bite the bullet and kiss Heather’s aerobicized ass… but J.D. has another plan for that bullet.</p>

                            <p>“ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD!” announces the ambassador from England. Tom Stoppard breathes new life into this hapless duo, who are poetically tricked into delivering the order of their own deaths.
                            In an inversion of Hamlet, the pair attempt to offer musings on the nature of reality and death as they remain trapped on stage, in between extravagant disruptions by the royal family, a roving band of actors, and a wildly unfortunate pirate attack. Despite their attempts to gain some control over their situation, the events of the play carry them inevitably, inexorably to their deaths.</p>

                            <p>Wednesday Addams, the ultimate princess of darkness, has grown up and found love with Lucas Beineke, a “normal” boy from Ohio, whom her parents have never met. She invites the Beineke family over for dinner at the Addams house in the hopes that her bizarre family can appear normal long enough to impress the Beinekes. However, Wednesday has a huge secret - she and Lucas are engaged. Wednesday knows that her mother, Morticia, will not approve, so she confides in her father, Gomez, and begs him not to tell Morticia. Now Gomez must do the impossible; he must keep a secret from his beloved wife, who values honesty above all in their marriage.</p>
